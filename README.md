Abstract. 
Energy disaggregation refers to the separation of appliance-level data from an aggregate
energy signal originated from a single-meter, without the use of any other device-specific
sensors. Due to the fact that deep learning caught great attention in the last decade, numerous
techniques using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been developed to accomplish this
task. Whereas most of the current research focuses on achieving better performance, the goal of
this paper is to design a computationally light deep neural network based on attention mecha -
nism. A thorough analysis shows how the proposed model is implemented and compares the
performance of two different attention layers in the problem of energy disaggregation. The
novel architecture achieves fast training and inference with minor performance trade-off when
compared against other computationally expensive state-of-the-art models .
